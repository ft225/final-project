Luigi Caccia Dominioni was Born in Milan in 1913.

<p>Some of Hoffmann's domestic designs can still be found in production today, such as the Rundes Modell cutlery set that is manufactured by Alessi. Originally produced in silver the range is now produced in high quality stainless steel. Another example of Hoffmann’s strict geometrical lines and the quadratic theme is the iconic Kubus Armchair. Designed in 1910, it was presented at the International Exhibition held in Buenos Aires on the centennial of Argentinean Independence known as May Revolution. Hoffmann's constant use of squares and cubes earned him the nickname Quadratl-Hoffmann ("Square Hoffmann").</p>

Named for its 80 x 80 cm base made for supporting extra-large tops, this dining table has a rare brilliance. The round version has a diameter of 180 or 190 cm and the oval is wide or as Caccia put it "fat" (160 x 210 cm). The polyester gloss lacquer reduces light absorbency making the top into a black reflective mirror. The 16 cm-high steel band on the base protects the table from scuffing and above all, on account of the material and its inclination with respect to the floor, adds a mirrored surface that multiplies the effects of the light. Also in the version with the mahogany top with black gloss lacquered rounded edge, the Base Quadra is one of the many pieces designed by Luigi Caccia Dominioni that emanates indirect light.
Table with oval top with black gloss polyester lacquer, "torus" moulding in solid wood, base in wood with stainless steel band, 160 x 205 cm, height 72 cm.
Base Quadra top 160 x 205 cm or round diameter 160 cm thickness 25 mm.
Available in black gloss polyester lacquer or mahogany veneer with clear polyester finish.

Catilina was unveiled in 1957 at the 11th Triennale in Milan and was used in an exhibition of Italian sculptor Francesco Somaini’s works in Como the following year. It has since come to be considered a milestone in the history of Italian design. 
Catilina has been revisited over the course of the years and is currently available in a number of versions, including a small version (for use with tables), a steel version (plays on reflected light) and a low version (virtually an armchair). The curve of the backrest follows a precisely calculated geometry. 
The issue was to model an iron bar into a ribbon that would compensate for the severity of the seat. A few short centimetres are all that is required for the ribbon of metal to curve into a comfortable high armrest. By this alchemy the sitter is offered the luxury of gliding their back along the sinuous contours of the backrest while remaining elegantly upright.
The frame in metallic automobile grey powdercoated cast iron supports an oval seat in polyester lacquered wood and leather or velvet cushion (size according to model).
